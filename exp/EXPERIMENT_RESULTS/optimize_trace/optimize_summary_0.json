      "title": "Missing facing keys in delta outputs causing guaranteed 0 facing scores",
      "description": "31 objects across 15/25 scenes had no 'facing' key in the final predicted map. The delta format allows partial updates, and the model omits facing for small objects (cap, wine, basket, candle, plant, desklamp, etc.) it considers faceless. Once inserted without facing at step 1, later deltas never add it back. Fixed by adding post-processing in apply_delta() that fills missing facing with the opposite of the agent's facing direction."

      "title": "Weak facing enforcement in prompt for delta format",
      "description": "The original prompt said to include facing 'if its facing has changed or if it is newly observed' which was too permissive for delta format. Changed to make facing mandatory for ALL delta entries, added explicit list of small objects that need facing (caps, pans, cups, lamps, etc.), and added a default heuristic instruction."

      "description": "Original Condition C used temperature=1.0 while optimized Condition B used 0.5. Higher temperature adds noise that compounds across sequential delta steps. Lowered to 0.5."

  "success": true,
  "summary": "Fixed structural weakness in delta-map format where missing facing keys caused guaranteed 0 facing scores for 31 objects across 15/25 scenes. Applied three fixes: (1) post-processing in apply_delta() to fill missing facing with opposite of agent facing, (2) strengthened prompt to make facing mandatory for all delta entries, (3) lowered temperature from 1.0 to 0.5. Results improved: overall 0.2278 -> 0.2356 (+3.4%), facing 0.2231 -> 0.2528 (+13.3%). Optimized C is now the best condition overall (vs A=0.2187, B=0.2246)."
