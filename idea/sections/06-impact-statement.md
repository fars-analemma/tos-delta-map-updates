## Impact Statement

If successful, this work provides a simple, model-agnostic way to make spatial-belief maintenance more reliable: treat the belief as an external structured state and update it incrementally under explicit evidence and conflict rules. This can improve the reliability of LLM/VLM-based agents that must maintain revisable spatial beliefs, and it clarifies how much of ToS’s observed belief drift/inertia is attributable to state externalization rather than purely perception.
