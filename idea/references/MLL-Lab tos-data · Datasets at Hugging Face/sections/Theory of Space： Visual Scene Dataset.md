Theory of Space： Visual Scene Dataset
This dataset provides pre-rendered 3D multi-room environments for evaluating spatial reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs). It is designed to support the Theory of Space (ToS) benchmark, which tests whether foundation models can actively construct spatial beliefs through exploration.
