You observe at your front-right, generate action sequence Belief on Survey: Building an allocentric map Belief on Route: Reasoning about paths and landmark relations Route Survey View2Location If you see at your right front, where are you Allocentric Map What's 2D coordinate of Figure 3: THEORY OF SPACE exploitation task suite: it covers route-level egocentric reasoning and survey-level allocentric mapping. Route tasks evaluate path-based inference and egocentric observations. Survey tasks test global mapping, geometric transformation, and perspective conversion. Together they cover both local navigation reasoning and global spatial abstraction. Dynamic Group Belief on Route Belief on Survey Static Pairwise Relation (direction) report allocentric direction and distance from A to B. Allocentric Mapping (alloc.map) predict global coordinates (and headings) for all objects. Forward Dynamics Perspective Taking (persp.take) output the observation from a specified object's perspective. Action-to-View (act2view) given a sequence of Goto/Rotate, predict the final observation (one object in FOV with ego direction/distance bins). Mental Rotation (ment.rot) predict the sequence of front-facing objects during a 360 • self-rotation. Location2View (loc2view) given a global pose, predict the observation (one object in FOV with ego bins/distances).
