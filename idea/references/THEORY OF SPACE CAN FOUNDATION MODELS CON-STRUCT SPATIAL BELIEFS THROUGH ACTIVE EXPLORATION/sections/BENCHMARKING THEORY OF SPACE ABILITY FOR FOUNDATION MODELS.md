BENCHMARKING THEORY OF SPACE ABILITY FOR FOUNDATION MODELS
Unlike task-driven benchmarks that only test task completion, we aim to answer "can the agent form a global environmental belief through exploration?". We structure the benchmarking into two phases. In the Exploration Phase I, the agent interacts with the environment to construct spatial belief by selecting and executing actions in the action space in § 3.1, and gather a sequence of local observations to integrate them into a unified spatial belief. In the Reasoning Phase II, the agent is asked to conduct spatial tasks (detailed in § 3.2).
