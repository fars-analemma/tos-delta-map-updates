Backward Dynamics
Perspective Decision (perc.dec) infer which object's perspective the agent is currently adopting. View-to-Action (view2act) recover an action sequence that produces a target observation. View2Location (view2loc) localize the agent (and optionally orientation) from a target observation under the map. Table 1: Task suite comparison: Route belief emphasizes egocentric, step-by-step path reasoning; Survey belief emphasizes allocentric mapping and novel view inference. (calculated by AC-3 algorithm). The efficiency is calculated as E = 1 - N i=1 log 2 max(1,Ci) N log 2 M . This score ranges from 0 (no information gained, C i = M ) to 1 (all objects perfectly localized, C i = 1). Note that it can also be used to calculate the accumulated information gain at each step. Information gain is mainly used in text-based environments, since vision-based environments have direct access to scenes without such ambiguity. Therefore, for vision-based environments, we directly use node coverage to measure exploration efficiency. Belief Representation and Quality Assessment. A core contribution of THEORY OF SPACE is disentangling spatial memory from spatial inference. We structurally decompose the probed cognitive map into two components: • (D2) The Cognitive Map (Observed): Measures fidelity and coherent integration of observations over time. We evaluate using two criteria: (1) Correctness, alignment with ground truth, computed as a composite of positional, directional, and facing accuracy; and (2) dynamic reasoning diagnostics, including Perception quality, Self-tracking, Stability, and Local ↔ Global Consistency, reflecting internal coherence such as the absence of contradictions within the relational graph and between maps and relations. • (D3) The Uncertainty Map (Unobserved): Measures how well the agent models plausible hypotheses about unobserved regions. We assess Uncertainty Modeling by providing a candidate set of positions formed by randomly sampled points from both observed and unobserved areas, and measuring the agent's ability to identify valid locations via F 1 . This separation lets us diagnose whether failures stem from misestimating the observed world or from insufficient reasoning about what remains unobserved. (D4) Belief Revision. Measures the agent's ability to revise its spatial belief under latent environment changes. We evaluate this using the False Belief task ( §5.3), where objects are covertly manipulated (translated or rotated) following the initial exploration. The agent must re-explore to detect these discrepancies; we measure the accuracy of these identified changes (both object identity and transformation type) using the F 1 score. Furthermore, we introduce Belief Inertia to quantify whether belief revision remain biased toward obsolete priors. (D5) Belief Exploitation Success. Measures task success when the agent must utilize its spatial belief. For tasks involving spatial relations (direction, persp.take, action2view), we score direction and distance separately, awarding 0.5 for each correct component. For tasks that output coordinates (view2loc, alloc.map), we compute a coordinate similarity score.
