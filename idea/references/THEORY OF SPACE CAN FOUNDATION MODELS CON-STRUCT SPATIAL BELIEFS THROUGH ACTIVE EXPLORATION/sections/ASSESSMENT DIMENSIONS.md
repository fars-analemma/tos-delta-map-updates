ASSESSMENT DIMENSIONS
We define assessment dimensions that align with the core THEORY OF SPACE abilities: construction and revision are evaluated via exploration efficiency and belief quality, while exploitation is evaluated via task success. (D1) Belief Construction Efficiency. Measures how efficiently the agent collapses spatial uncertainty during exploration. We quantify this using a normalized information gain metric, E. Let M be the number of possible positions for any object at the start of exploration (a uniform prior), and let C i be the number of positions for object i that remain consistent with all observations gathered by the agent
