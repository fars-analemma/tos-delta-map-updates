DOWNSTREAM SPATIAL TASKS
We use open-ended questions rather than multiple-choice questions to reduce the risk of knowledge leakage. Drawing on prior work ~\cite{b44,b34}, we define tasks to evaluate an agent's Route and Survey knowledge, shown in Table 1. Route belief captures how an agent encodes paths and spatial relations from an egocentric step-by-step perspective. Survey belief is a map-like, allocentric representation. An overview of the tasks is present in Figure 3.
