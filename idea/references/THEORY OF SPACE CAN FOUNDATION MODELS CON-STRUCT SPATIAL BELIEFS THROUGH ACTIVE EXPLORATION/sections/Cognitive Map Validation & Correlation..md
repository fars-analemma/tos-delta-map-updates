Cognitive Map Validation & Correlation.
To validate the utility of the probed cognitive map and investigate whether it faithfully reflects the agent's reasoning process, we first conducted two ablation studies: • Sufficiency Test (Oracle Map): We conditioned the model on the ground-truth cognitive map before generating answers for evaluation. Performance rose to near-perfect levels (≈ 95% for both models in both worlds). This confirms that our cognitive map representation captures all necessary information for the tasks; performance bottlenecks stem from the agent's inability to accurately construct the map, not the representation format itself. • Alignment Test (Explicit Reasoning): We prompted the model to explicitly generate the cognitive map before answering the evaluation questions. This resulted in a slight performance degradation compared to direct answering. These results reveal an externalization gap: the model's latent internal spatial belief is richer or more accurate than the discretized JSON output it produces. While it is a lossy compression of the agent's true internal state, the explicit map remains a strong diagnostic signal. We support this claim by computing the Pearson correlation between the agent's cognitive map Correctness and downstream task performance. To ensure a robust correlation, we calculate the average performance across five independent cognitive map runs for each sample. As shown in Table 6, belief correctness is consistently and positively correlated with downstream success in both modalities, with all correlations significant (p < .001). The association is stronger in vision (r=0.570/0.645) than in text (r=0.418/0.466). The stronger vision correlation suggests that perception-driven mapping errors and unstable belief updates more directly translate into task failures. Thus, we establish map probing as a validated diagnostic proxy for failure analysis. While acknowledging that correlation does not imply causality, we treat the explicit map as a robust, albeit conservative, signal for diagnosing reasoning breakdowns rather than definitive evidence. Key Findings: Maps as a Diagnostic Proxy • Lossy but Diagnostic: Though a lossy compression, map correctness correlates significantly with downstream success, making it a strong diagnostic signal.
