Key Findings: Vision Deficiencies & Belief Inertia
• Vision-based Revision Failures: Vision agents suffer from excessive exploration redundancy and poor accuracy in identifying object shifts. • Belief Inertia: Agents, especially vision-based ones, persist in obsolete spatial coordinates despite new observations. a l l r e d . o r i . p o s . o r i . p o s . o r i . p o s .

After relocating/reorienting k=4 objects, we evaluate change identification, re-exploration cost (including redundancy (red.)), and belief correctness/update in text-vs. vision-worlds. Vision agents require more redundant steps and show severe orientation inertia, failing to overwrite obsolete facing beliefs despite new evidence.
