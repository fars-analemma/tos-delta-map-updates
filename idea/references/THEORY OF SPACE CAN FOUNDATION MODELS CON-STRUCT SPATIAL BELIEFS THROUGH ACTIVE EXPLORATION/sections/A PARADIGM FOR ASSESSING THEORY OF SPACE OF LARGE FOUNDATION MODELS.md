A PARADIGM FOR ASSESSING THEORY OF SPACE OF LARGE FOUNDATION MODELS
We propose a new paradigm for Assessing THEORY OF SPACE of large foundation models, which consists of three essential components below. Task-Agonistic Active Exploration to Move From Passive Viewer to Active Explorer. Evaluating THEORY OF SPACE requires a shift from downstream tasks to exploration, i.e., how an agent explores and decides "what to see next". In detail, we place the agent in a partially observable environment and explicitly challenge the LLM/VLM agent to actively select actions for itself, including moving, rotating, observing, and terminating. The primary goal is not to complete a downstream task or follow pre-collected trajectories, but to build a general-purpose internal model from its own self-directed exploration with minimal cost. This process encompasses both initial Belief Construction and dynamic Belief Revision. Inspired by the false belief paradigm in Theory of Mind ~\cite{b51} and spatial belief revision ~\cite{b24}, we evaluate whether an agent can detect dynamic environmental changes and correctly revise its internal belief during exploration. This demonstrates the ability to customize beliefs given evolving observations. Consequently, the model must identify what remains uncertain and actively terminate exploration only upon acquiring sufficient evidence to form an accurate and responsive internal map. Belief Exploitation Assessment. To translate THEORY OF SPACE into concrete evaluation tasks, we draw insights from the development of spatial representations ~\cite{b44,b34} and define two tasks to measure an agent's ability to exploit its internal belief for goal-directed behavior: (1) Belief on Route evaluates a path-based understanding of space organized around landmarks such as pairwise spatial relationships along a egocentric navigation; (2) Belief on Survey assesses a map-like "bird's-eye view" that represents space allocentrically, allowing for the inference of global relationships. Explicit Probing of the Internal Spatial Belief. Behavioral success such as whether the agent finds the chair cannot directly reveal the quality of agent's internal model. We require the agent to explicitly represent its spatial belief by probing its cognitive map at any point of exploration. Cognitive maps are structured allocentric representations of space, which is well-established in neuroscience ~\cite{b47,b36,b18}. Thus, we use cognitive maps as the canonical representation of the hidden structure of space. In our implementation, we probe the agent's internal belief by requiring it to externalize a structured cognitive map. We evaluate the map's Correctness, and we diagnose reasoning breakdowns with dynamic signals that capture how reliably observations are integrated, tracked over time, and kept coherent across local and global structure. Additionally, we explicitly test the agent's belief on uncertainty by identifying unobserved regions to measure its uncertainty modeling. This shifts the evaluation from behavioral success to a direct assessment of representational competence, giving us a window into the agent's spatial belief development.
