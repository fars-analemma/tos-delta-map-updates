Definition: THEORY OF SPACE
Ability to construct, revise, and exploit an internal spatial belief. Here, an internal spatial belief is a mental model ~\cite{b46} of spatial layout and relations maintained in working memory and updated from partial observations. We formalize THEORY OF SPACE within a partially observable framework over a spatial structure S ∈ S. The agent interacts with S to generate a history h t = (o 0:t , a 0:t ), where o and a denote observations and actions. We define THEORY OF SPACE as the capacity to manipulate a probabilistic belief B t through three core operations: 1. Construct: To form a globally consistent internal spatial belief by actively seeking out and integrating partial observations. Formally, the agent integrates h t to approximate the true posterior, denoted as B t (S) ≈ P (S | h t ). 2. Revise: To dynamically update the internal belief by using new information acquired through further exploration to resolve conflicts with prior beliefs. Upon an environmental shift S → S ′ , the agent utilizes exploratory actions ∆h to minimize the divergence from the new ground truth, i.e., B t+∆t → P (S ′ | h t+∆t ). 3. Exploit: To utilize the current belief to support spatial tasks. The agent utilizes a policy π conditioned on the belief, π(a t | B t ), to perform a downstream task T . In a benchmark context, we measure the value of belief by the performance metric J achieved by this policy: J (π(•|B t ), T ).
