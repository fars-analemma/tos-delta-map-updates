CONCLUSIONS
We introduce THEORY OF SPACE, which asks whether foundation models can function as spatial agents under partial observability: not merely answering questions from fixed views, but actively acquiring information through self-directed exploration to construct, revise, and exploit an internal spatial belief. Building on this framing, we contribute a new evaluation paradigm centered on task-agnostic active exploration, downstream spatial tasks for belief exploitation assessment, and explicit probing of internal beliefs via cognitive-map externalization. We implement THEORY OF SPACE in a multimodal environment that instantiates parallel text-and vision-based worlds, enabling controlled diagnosis of failures across symbolic versus perceptual observation streams. A key strength of this design is that it makes spatial belief measurable rather than implicit. By requiring models to externalize evolving cognitive maps and uncertainty over unobserved regions, THEORY OF SPACE evaluates more than end task accuracy: it reveals the correctness, internal consistency, and temporal dynamics of belief formation, and quantifies how localized mistakes propagate into global map corruption over time. Empirically, active exploration is a major bottleneck: end-task performance drops and exploration is less efficient than passive viewing, with the gap widening as room complexity increases. Belief probes make these error sources explicit: in vision, perception error often appears early, and models also exhibit belief instability, where correct information is later overwritten or forgotten, cascading into inconsistencies and lower map fidelity. Finally, when environments change and previously held beliefs must be revised, models exhibit strong belief inertia. They fail to overwrite obsolete priors, and this inertia is especially pronounced for vision-based models, particularly for orientation and facing updates. Taken together, THEORY OF SPACE reframes spatial evaluation from "can the model answer?" to "can the model build and maintain a coherent, revisable spatial world model through efficient information gathering?" We hope this benchmark and its belief-centric measurements provide a foundation for developing models with (i) uncertainty-aware and efficient exploration policies, (ii) robust state/belief maintenance under long horizons, and (iii) reliable mechanisms for revising beliefs when the world changes.  Information Gain Calculation We use the AC-3 arc-consistency algorithm to maintain, for each object, a domain of feasible grid cells. Initially, every object's domain spans the entire 20 × 20 map. Each new observation is compiled into unary and binary constraints (e.g., egocentric direction/distance bins, room visibility/occlusion, and ALLDIFFERENT to prevent collisions). When a constraint is added, AC-3 iteratively prunes any cell in one object's domain that is unsupported by the domains of related objects, propagating revisions along incident arcs until a fixed point is reached (all arcs are consistent). While AC-3 alone does not guarantee global consistency, in our setting all constraints are derived from a valid trajectory; therefore the ground-truth assignment remains supported and is never pruned, ensuring that domains stay non-empty throughout propagation.
