BELIEF REVISION TASK
Spatial intelligence requires not only mapping static environments but also maintaining beliefs under non-stationarity. Inspired by false belief protocols in developmental psychology ~\cite{b51,b2} and spatial belief revision ~\cite{b24}, we introduce a dynamic perturbation task to probe the agent's ability to discard obsolete priors and reintegrate new evidence. Task Protocol. Following the initial exploration phase, we introduce a discrete environmental shift: a subset of k = 4 objects are stochastically relocated or reoriented. The agent, retaining its memory (exploration history), must actively re-explore the environment to identify the state changes. This requires the agent to detect conflicts between its internal belief state and new sensory observations. Metrics. We evaluate performance along four complementary axes: • Identification Accuracy (F 1 ): How precisely the agent pinpoints which objects changed. We compute the F 1 score for detecting the subset of objects whose position or orientation shifted. • Average Steps: How efficiently the agent revises its beliefs to completion. We report Total Steps needed to identify all changes, and Redundancy Steps, defined as the number of steps taken after the last changed object has been observed. Ideally, Redundancy → 0, indicating the agent recognizes when updating is complete. • Belief Correctness: How accurate the updated beliefs are on the changed subset. We compute correctness as in §5.1, but restrict evaluation to changed objects to isolate the fidelity of reexploration. • Belief Inertia: Whether updating remains systematically biased toward obsolete priors. To quantify attraction back to pre-shift beliefs, we test whether the residual error of the updated belief aligns with the direction of the old belief. For each shifted object i, let b old i denote the pre-shift belief, b new i the post-revision belief, and g new i the post-shift ground truth. Define the prior-offset and post-revision error vectors: v i = b old i -g new i , e i = b new i -g new i . We define positional inertia as s pos i = e ⊤ i v i ∥e i ∥ ∥v i ∥ + ϵ Directional alignment (cos θi) • exp - ∥b new i -b old i ∥ 2 2σ 2
